# hi-tech-job-resources

This code creates a simple webpage with job links, and it uses JavaScript to provide a hover effect that displays descriptions when you mouse over the job links

When you hover over one of the job links (the images), JavaScript code is used to toggle the display of the hidden description. In other words, when you move your mouse over a job link, it shows a brief description of the company and its services, and when you move your mouse away, the description is hidden again.
